LSIS 5010: Information Science Fall 2020. This project is to suggest an enhancement to an existing entity.

SYNOPSIS:
COVID-19 has impacted the world in ways that the general population could not predict.
In order to help improve the efficiency of the NCCU Campus Pantry, Team 5 has suggested to implement an online ordering system where NCCU students can view inventory, with the convenience of the internet, in order to streamline this process.
